This Plugin sets `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` to 2.
When it is disabled, it resets the value back to its default. 
This way, you can choose if you want to have everything zoomed by the factor 2 or not by disabling and enabling this addon on your addon-manager.

You can either update this setting manually in `about:config`. 
Or better yet, you can do it by installing this Add-On into firefox.
