This Plugin sets `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` to 2.
When it is disabled, it resets the value back to its default. 
This way, you can choose if you want to have everything zoomed by the factor 2 or not by disabling and enabling this addon on your addon-manager.

Setting can be toggled on/off with a click of the button

You can either update this setting manually in `about:config`. 
Or better yet, you can do it by installing this Add-On into firefox.

#Alternative:

Also a nice Addon: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/autohidpi/">AutoHiDPI</a> which might even be the better solution than this.
